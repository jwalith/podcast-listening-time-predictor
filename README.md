# Podcast Listening Time Predictor ðŸŽ§

A Machine Learning project to predict how long users are likely to listen to a podcast episode based on episode features.
ML Projects	- Built and deployed a Machine Learning model using FastAPI to predict podcast listening time based on episode features; integrated a trained Random Forest pipeline with real-time prediction API; implemented API documentation using Swagger.
This project uses:
- **scikit-learn** to train the ML model
- **FastAPI** to build a lightweight backend API
- **Swagger UI** to test the API interactively

## How to Run Locally ðŸš€

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/podcast-listening-time-predictor.git
cd podcast-listening-time-predictor
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

4. Open browser and visit:
